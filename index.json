If they generate a recovery token manually in the account settings, a MailCrypt key pair gets created for them. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t enable MailCrypt for them automatically, though. In order to enable MailCrypt for a legacy user, do the following:\n Ensure that they have a recovery token generated. This will automatically generate MailCrypt key pair as well. This step can only be done by the account holder, as the user password is required to do so. Manually set mailCrypt=1 for the user in the virtual_users database table. This needs to be done manually on a per-user basis on purpose.  Please note that existing mails will not be encrypted automatically. Instead, all existing mail stays unencrypted and only new incoming mail will be stored encrypted.\nIn bin/mailcrypt-encrypt-maildir you find a script to encrypt unencrypted mail from legacy mailboxes that already have a MailCrypt key configured. This script needs to be invoked as a user who has write access to the mailbox in question - probably the best is to run it as root:\n./bin/mailcrypt-encrypt-maildir user@example.org  The following SQL statement can be used to enable MailCrypt for all legacy users that generated a recovery token in the meantime (and thus have a MailCrypt key). Use with caution!\nUPDATE virtual_users SET mailCrypt=1 WHERE recoverySecretBox IS NOT NULL AND mailCryptSecretBox IS NOT NULL;  We might add a migration script to encrypt old mails from existing users at a later point.\n"
