    Dear user,

    Welcome aboard. You can find guides for setting up your email account
    with several client programs in the internet.

    You get a mailbox with 1GB quota. If you exceed your quota limit,
    your email account may not function properly.

    In one week you will receive three invite codes, which you can collect
    at %app_url%/voucher. You can pass these on to friends and
    invite them to register with %project_name%.

    Sincerly, your %project_name% admin team.
  recovery-subject: The password for your email account %email% will be reset
  recovery-body: |
    Hello %email%,

    Somebody tried to reset your account password. To do so, they
    authenticated with your email address and corresponding recovery
    code at %app_url%/recovery.

    You didn't trigger this yourself? Then somebody else with access to
    your recovery token tries to get hold of your account. You should go
    to %app_url%/user/recovery_token immediately and create a
    new recovery token. This will invalidate the old recovery token and
    stop the process.

    If you did trigger the process yourself, the 48 hours waiting period
    started now. It will end at %time%. Afterwards, you can set
    a new password can at %app_url%/recovery.

    We hope you continue to enjoy your email account.
    Your %project_name% admin team.
  alias-created-subject: New alias address created
  alias-created:body: |
    Hello %email%,

    For your email address %email% a new alias has been added:
    %alias%

    Manage your email aliases here: %app_url%/alias

    We hope you continue to enjoy your email account.
    Your %project_name% admin team.
